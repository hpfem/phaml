This is very simple example that solves Poisson's equation on
the unit square with Dirichlet boundary conditions such that
the exact solution is x**2 + y**2.  It uses 2 processors (unless
compiled as a sequential program where nproc is ignored, or with
messpass_nospawn where number of processors is determined by the
launching command) and prints the grid information and norms of
the error after each refine/solve loop.
