This is very simple example that solves Poisson's equation on
the unit square with periodic boundary conditions on the top and
bottom and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the right side, and natural
boundary conditions on the left side.  It uses 2 processors (unless compiled
as a sequential program where nproc is ignored, or with messpass_nospawn where
number of processors is determined by the launching command) and prints the
grid information and norms of the error after each refine/solve loop.
