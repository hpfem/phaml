This example illustrates solving a nonlinear elliptic PDE by Picard iteration.
The PDE is

                 u
   u   + u   = -e   in Omega = (0,1)X(0,1)
    xx    yy

           u = 0    on the boundary of Omega


The Picard iteration is

                        (n)
    (n+1)    (n+1)     U
   U      + U      = -e
    xx       yy
