*) If update_usermod is used to set a parameter that is used in the definition
of the true solution, the graphics process does not get the new parameter, so
its display of the true solution and true error is wrong.

*) The quadrature in unowned elements is not exactly the same as the quadrature
in the processor that owns the element, which causes an inconsistency in
the parallel hierarchical basis multigrid method so that it does not reduce
the residual to 0.  It does, however, seem to reduce the error below the
discretization error, so the method does provide an adequate solution.  But
in some cases the test for termination of multigrid iterations based on the
size of the residual is never satisfied, so you should (for now) put a limit
on the number of iterations via the mg_cycles parameter to phaml_solve_pde,
e.g. mg_cycles=5, if running in parallel.

*) For systems of equations, the L1 sum and L2 sum of the components in the
graphics is wrong if using high order elements and subelement resolution.

*) The PETSc preconditioners Eisenstat, ICC and ILU generate the PETSc error
code 56.

*) "make test" with openmpi fails for the interactive tests because mpirun
is not used (because stdin doesn't get through it) and openmpi requires it.

*) the test suite is not available for SPMD model

*) the test suite does not support PVM

*) BLOPEX can have problems with agressively optimized versions of LAPACK,
because the optimization can break an invariance property that BLOPEX assumes.
If you find that "make test what=blopexp" gives results that are significantly
different from the comparison files, try using "BLAS source LAPACK source"
when you run mkmkfile.sh.

*) the explicit and equilibrated residual error estimators do not get
the optimal convergence rate when the cross derivative term cxy is nonzero.
Use one of the other error estimators.

*) the color key does not get resized when the graphics window is resized.
You have to toggle the key off and back on again to resize it, or better yet,
resize the window with the key off and then toggle it on.
